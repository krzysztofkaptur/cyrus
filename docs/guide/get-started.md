# Getting started

This project can be used in 2 main ways.

## Basic

Use provided endpoints as is, by sending a request to e.g. `https://cyrus-api.com/api/v1/todos`. This approach is a bit limited as adding, updating, and deleting are not doing much more than just returning some JSON. Those endpoints don't hit a database so users won't override datasets for each other.

## Local

Clone the repository from GitHub and integrate it locally alongside your project. The code for adding, updating, and deleting data (connected to a database) has been provided within comments. Simply uncomment the relevant sections to take full control of your datasets.

Cyrus API uses [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) for connecting with database and [FakerJS](https://fakerjs.dev/) to create datasets.

You can use prepared scripts to handle DB:

- `npm run db:generate` - generate migrations based on schemas
- `npm run db:migrate` - runs migrations
- `npm run db:seed` - seeds database with data generated by FakerJS
- `npm run db:ui` - runs Drizzle Studio on [https://local.drizzle.studio](https://local.drizzle.studio) - a database UI
