# Getting started

This project can be used in 2 main ways.

## Basic

Use provided endpoints as is, by sending a request to e.g. `https://cyrus-api.com/api/v1/todos`. This approach is a bit limited as adding, updating, and deleting are not doing much more than just returning some JSON. Those endpoints don't hit a database so users won't override datasets for each other.

## Advanced

Clone it and use it locally next to your project. Add missing database requests so you can use its full capabilities.
